## Dia&Co Test

### Instructions:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `yarn start` to start development version.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
4. Can also do `yarn build` to build production version.

### How I Would Improve It
- Break down the components into smaller pieces using [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
- Create a theme and custom create all components instead of using Bulma
- Use i18next to localize strings
- Localize date and times
- Nicer error handling (no results, invalid search, etc.)
